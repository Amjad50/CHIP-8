# CHIP-8

This is an interpreter implementation for [CHIP-8](chip8-wiki) by me as a fun side project, and to get beginning with building emulators and other fun stuff.

This is built using [rust](rust-site), and [gtk](gtk-site) for gui.

Any suggestions and edits are welcomed in the issues and pull requests.
